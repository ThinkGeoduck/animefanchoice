Note: The shadcn/ui components are already available in the project by default at @/components/ui/. 

These include:
- button.tsx
- card.tsx
- input.tsx
- dropdown-menu.tsx
- etc.

You can import them directly like:
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card"

There's no need to create these files manually as they're part of the default project setup.
